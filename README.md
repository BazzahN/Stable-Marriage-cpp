# Stable-Marriage-cpp
This repository contains all my solutions to the C++ assignment. I also include brief descriptions on how to run the code for each of the **Tasks: 1,2,3 and 5**. For saftey reasons, I have chosen to ommit the self-referential **Task 4**, so as to prevent the reader from falling into a recursive loop.

>Add a README markdown file containing instructions for compiling and running your code for each of the Tasks 1, 2, and 3. Check that your README file renders properly on github.

## Task 1

Contents of **Task 1** folder:
```
IS_STABLE.cpp
IS_STABLE.h // Header .h and source file .cpp for IS_STABLE algorithm 

fun_algo.cpp
fun_algo.h // Ditto for the 'fundamental algorithm'

utils.cpp
utils.h //Ditto for Utilities

main_t1.cpp //Main source file 

```



###Compiling
